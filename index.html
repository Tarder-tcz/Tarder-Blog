        <p class="para2" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            He is your average 18 year old teenager who is curious just about everything around him (and yes I am speaking in 3rd person). If he gets fixated on something, he will make damn sure that he finishes what he has started. For example, he was just 14 years old when he started learning video editing. This endeavour only sparked because he saw a very funny YouTube video and then it lead to another thing and then another thing which at the end lead to him learning Adobe Premiere Pro for 2 years.

          <b>Minecraft?</b> Who plays this game made for children?

          So let me tell you a story... well not a big one but it's interesting. Tarder was only 8 years old when he first saw an Android rip-off version of Minecraft on his friend's Phone. He took a particular interest in this <b>"Game"</b> and begged his parents to buy it for him. Young Tarder would spend around 2 hours everyday devoted to Minecraft. Even as of present in the year 2023, he still creates magnificent builds in it honing his skills as a designer and builder. If you want to see some of his work, you can click on either of the buttons on the navbar at the top (Instagram or Artstation) to see his work so far.
